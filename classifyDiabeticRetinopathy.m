function [drStatus, vesselDensity] = classifyDiabeticRetinopathy(segmentedBW)
    % Classifies diabetic retinopathy status based on segmented vessel image.
    %
    % IMPORTANT: This is a simplified placeholder for demonstration.
    % A real ML model would involve:
    % 1. Feature Extraction: Extracting robust features (e.g., vessel tortuosity,
    %    branching patterns, lesion detection) from 'segmentedBW' and possibly 'originalImage'.
    % 2. Trained Model: Loading a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., SVM,
    %    Random Forest, Neural Network) that was trained on a labeled dataset
    %    (Normal vs. DR).
    % 3. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict 'Normal' or 'DR'.
    %
    % For this example, we use a simple vessel density threshold.

    % Convert to logical if not already
    segmentedBW = logical(segmentedBW);

    % Calculate vessel density as a simple feature
    vesselPixels = sum(segmentedBW(:));
    totalPixels = numel(segmentedBW);
    vesselDensity = vesselPixels / totalPixels;

    % --- Simple Threshold-based Classification (Placeholder for ML Model) ---
    % These thresholds are arbitrary and for demonstration only.
    % In a real application, these would be learned by a classifier.
    highDensityThreshold = 0.08; % Example threshold
    
    if vesselDensity > highDensityThreshold
        drStatus = 'Diabetic Retinopathy Detected';
    else
        drStatus = 'Normal Retinal Vasculature';
    end

    % You can also add more nuanced conditions based on other features if extracted.
    % Example:
    % if vesselDensity > highDensityThreshold && someOtherFeature > threshold2
    %    drStatus = 'Severe DR';
    % elseif vesselDensity > mediumDensityThreshold
    %    drStatus = 'Mild DR';
    % else
    %    drStatus = 'Normal';
    % end
